This is a collection of pd externals. No fancy stuff, just my
personal bag of (ahem) tricks...

Edit Makefile.config, type make.

add the library to the pd startup line, and specify the
path for the included abstractions (<crebdir>/abs)

Documentation packages in doc/
See doc/reference.txt for a list of objects

The package only includes linux + darwin makefiles. It is plain c/c++ so
porting should be relatively simple.

For compilation on OSX, see README.darwin (thanks to Adam Lindsay for
the darwin makefiles)

Enjoy,

Tom
